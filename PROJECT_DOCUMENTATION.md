## Platform Overview

### Purpose of the Partner Dashboard

The dashboard enables partners (NGOs, governments, school networks) to:
- Create and manage educational projects
- Invite and collaborate with schools and teachers
- Track and evaluate impact across multiple institutions
- Co-create or upload educational content
- Launch campaigns and outreach via a content engine

This adds a strategic layer to Class2Class—moving from individual teacher participation to institutional, agenda-driven collaboration.

### Key Principles
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Partners → Schools → Teachers → Students
- **Multi-level Collaboration**: Organizations can participate alongside individual educators
- **Scalable Impact**: Move beyond individual participation to institutional collaboration
- **UN SDG Alignment**: All projects align with Sustainable Development Goals
