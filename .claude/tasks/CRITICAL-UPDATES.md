# 🎨 PROJECT SCOPE: UI/UX Prototype

**Date:** October 7, 2025 (Updated 11:00 AM)
**Status:** CLARIFIED - This is a prototype, not a production system
**Purpose:** Build interactive mockup to test flows and validate UX

---

## 🎯 What This Project Actually Is

After discussion with the team, this project's scope has been **clarified**:

### ✅ This IS a Prototype

**Our Goal:** Build a fully functional UI/UX prototype using **sessionStorage/localStorage** to demonstrate all features and validate user flows.

**What We're Building:**
- ✅ Complete user interface for all stakeholder types
- ✅ Interactive flows (partner → coordinator → institution → teacher)
- ✅ Mock data layer using localStorage (persists for demos)
- ✅ Email preview modals (show what emails look like)
- ✅ Dashboard mockups with sample data
- ✅ Form validation and user interactions
- ✅ **Documentation** for real developers to build production system

### ❌ This IS NOT Production

**What We're NOT Building:**
- ❌ Real database (Supabase/PostgreSQL)
- ❌ Authentication system (Supabase Auth)
- ❌ Email integration (Resend/SendGrid)
- ❌ API routes with server-side logic
- ❌ File storage system
- ❌ Production deployment infrastructure

**Who Will Build Production:**
Real backend developers will use our prototype and documentation to build the production system (estimated 18-22 weeks after prototype handoff).

## 🏗️ Architecture Clarification

### Current State (By Design)

**File: `lib/supabase.ts`**
```typescript
import { createSessionClient } from './session-storage'
export const supabase = createSessionClient()
```
- ✅ **This is intentional** - Mock database for prototype
- ✅ Uses sessionStorage to simulate database operations
- ✅ Perfect for UI/UX testing without backend complexity

**File: `app/partner/schools/invite/page.tsx` (lines 110-112)**
```typescript
// Store invitations in localStorage for demo
const existingInvitations = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('sentInvitations') || '[]')
localStorage.setItem('sentInvitations', JSON.stringify(updatedInvitations))
```
- ✅ **This is intentional** - Local storage for prototype data
- ✅ Allows testing invitation flows without email service
- ✅ Data persists for stakeholder demos

### What We Need to Build (Prototype)

1. **localStorage Data Layer**
   - Mimic database operations (CRUD)
   - Store all entities: partners, programs, coordinators, institutions, teachers
   - Use same data structure as production database schema (documented)

2. **Mock Authentication**
   - Login/logout UI (stores "session" in localStorage)
   - Role switcher for testing different user types
   - Simple "logged in user" state management

3. **Email Preview Modals**
   - Show email content when "sending" invitations
   - Use React Email components for realistic preview
   - Confirmation UI instead of actual delivery

4. **Complete User Flows**
   - Partner creates program → invites co-partners
   - Partner invites coordinators → coordinators invite institutions
   - Institutions invite teachers → teachers create projects
   - Multi-level dashboards for all roles

---

## ✅ What's Already Working (Excellent Foundation)

1. **UI Components** - Shadcn/ui + Radix UI (professional, accessible)
2. **Form Handling** - React Hook Form + Zod validation (robust)
3. **Type Definitions** - TypeScript interfaces in `lib/types/partner.ts`
4. **Design System** - Consistent purple theme (#7F56D9)
5. **Multi-step Wizards** - Partner onboarding, school onboarding
6. **Component Architecture** - Clean, reusable, well-organized
7. **SessionStorage Mock** - Already implemented in `lib/session-storage.ts`

**This is a GREAT foundation for our prototype!**

---

## 📅 Updated Timeline (Prototype Scope)

**Original Misunderstanding:** 18-22 weeks (thought we were building production)
**Corrected Timeline:** **7-10 weeks** (prototype only)

### Prototype Phases:

```
Phase 1: Program Management & Co-Partners (Weeks 1-3)
├─ Program CRUD with localStorage
├─ Co-partner invitation flows
└─ Basic program dashboard

Phase 2: Coordinators & Institutions (Weeks 4-6)
├─ Coordinator flows and dashboard
├─ Institution onboarding
└─ Multi-level dashboards (Part 1)

Phase 3: Teachers & Complete Dashboards (Weeks 7-9)
├─ Teacher flows
├─ Project creation
└─ Multi-level dashboards (Part 2)

Phase 4: Polish & Handoff (Week 10)
├─ Seed data for demos
├─ Email preview modals
├─ UX testing
└─ Developer handoff documentation
```

**Target:** Prototype complete in 7-10 weeks (Dec 2025)

**Production Build (by real developers):** 18-22 weeks after prototype handoff

## 📚 Documentation Files (Reference for Production Team)

We've created comprehensive reference documentation for the **real developers** who will build the production system:

### 1. Database Schema Reference
**File:** `partner-program-implementation-plan.md`
- 90+ pages of technical specifications
- Complete database schema (10+ tables)
- **Purpose:** Reference for production developers
- **Our use:** Match this structure in localStorage

### 2. Data Relationship Diagrams
**File:** `RELATIONSHIP-DIAGRAM.md`
- Visual hierarchy: Partner → Program → Project
- Many-to-many relationships (co-partners)
- Real-world examples (Save the Children + LEGO + UNICEF)
- **Purpose:** Understand data structure for localStorage implementation

### 3. Backend Setup Guide
**File:** `PHASE-0-CHECKLIST.md`
- Week-by-week backend infrastructure setup
- Supabase, authentication, email integration
- **Purpose:** For production developers, NOT for us
- **Our focus:** Build UI that matches these specs

### 4. Implementation Status
**File:** `IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md`
- Project progress tracker
- What's done, what's next
- Updated to reflect prototype scope

## ❓ Questions & Decisions

### Prototype Implementation Decisions:

1. **Data Persistence:**
   - **Recommendation:** Use localStorage (persists between sessions)
   - **Benefit:** Better for demos and stakeholder testing
   - **Add:** "Clear Demo Data" button for reset

2. **Authentication:**
   - **Recommendation:** Build login UI, store session in localStorage
   - **Add:** Role switcher for testing (switch between partner/coordinator/teacher)

3. **Email Handling:**
   - **Recommendation:** Show email preview in modal when "sending"
   - **Use:** React Email components for realistic preview
   - **Benefit:** Stakeholders can review email copy

4. **Seed Data:**
   - **Recommendation:** Pre-populate 2-3 example programs
   - **Example:** Save the Children + LEGO + UNICEF (from docs)
   - **Benefit:** Immediate demo without setup

## 🎓 Key Takeaway

### Then (Misunderstanding):
❌ Thought we needed to build production system with real database
❌ Timeline was 18-22 weeks for full backend infrastructure
❌ Required Supabase, authentication, email service setup

### Now (Clarified):
✅ Building UI/UX prototype with localStorage
✅ Timeline is 7-10 weeks for complete prototype
✅ No backend infrastructure needed
✅ Focus on user flows and interactions
✅ Documentation guides future production build

---

## 📝 Summary

**This is GOOD NEWS!**

- We don't need to set up Supabase, authentication, or email services
- We can focus on what we do best: beautiful, functional UI/UX
- Timeline is much shorter: 7-10 weeks instead of 18-22 weeks
- Our prototype + documentation will guide production developers
- LocalStorage is perfect for testing all flows without backend complexity

**Path Forward:**

1. Finish updating documentation to reflect prototype scope
2. Build localStorage data layer matching database schema
3. Implement all user flows (partner → coordinator → institution → teacher)
4. Create email preview modals for all invitation types
5. Add seed data for realistic demos
6. Handoff prototype + documentation to production team
