# Implementation Status & Change Log

**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025, 11:00 AM
**Project Type:** 🎨 UI/UX Prototype (SessionStorage-based)
**Timeline:** 7-10 weeks for prototype completion

---

## 🎯 Project Scope Clarification

### What This Project IS:

✅ **Interactive UI/UX Prototype** - Fully functional interface to test all user flows
✅ **SessionStorage/localStorage-based** - Data clears on refresh (or persists for better testing)
✅ **Feature Demonstration** - Shows complete user journeys for all stakeholder types
✅ **Developer Reference** - Documentation and data structures for production implementation

### What This Project IS NOT:

❌ **Production System** - We're not building real backend infrastructure
❌ **Database Implementation** - Real developers will build Supabase/PostgreSQL
❌ **Authentication System** - Real developers will implement Supabase Auth
❌ **Email Service** - Real developers will integrate Resend/SendGrid

**Our Mission:** Build a fully functional prototype that validates UX, documents requirements, and provides clear specifications for the production team to implement.

## ❓ Open Questions (Prototype-Focused)

### High Priority (UX Decisions)

1. **Data Persistence for Prototype:**
   - Use sessionStorage (clears on refresh) or localStorage (persists)?
   - **Recommendation:** localStorage + "Clear Demo Data" button
   - **Why:** Better for stakeholder demos and UX testing

2. **Mock Authentication:**
   - Should we build login/logout screens?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes - build login UI, store "session" in localStorage
   - Include role switcher for testing (e.g., switch between partner/coordinator/teacher)

3. **Email Preview:**
   - Show email content in modal when sending invitations?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes - critical for stakeholders to review email copy
   - Use React Email components for preview

4. **Seed Data:**
   - Pre-populate with example programs, partners, schools?
   - **Recommendation:** Yes - include 2-3 example programs for immediate demo
   - Include: Save the Children + LEGO + UNICEF example from docs

### Medium Priority

5. **Navigation Between Roles:**
   - How do testers switch between Partner/Coordinator/Institution/Teacher views?
   - **Recommendation:** Dev-only "Role Switcher" in header (hidden in production)

6. **Data Reset:**
   - How do we reset prototype to clean state?
   - **Recommendation:** "Clear All Data" button in footer (dev-only)

7. **Multi-Program UI:**
   - How do users navigate between multiple programs in prototype?
   - Dropdown in header? Sidebar? Dashboard grid?
   - **Recommendation:** Dropdown in header + dashboard grid view
