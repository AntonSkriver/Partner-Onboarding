# Class2Class Partner Platform - Implementation Documentation

**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025, 1:30 PM
**Project Type:** üé® UI/UX Prototype (localStorage-based)
**Timeline:** 7-10 weeks for prototype completion

> **Prototype Team Reminder:** This folder guides our UI/UX prototype work. Keep focusing on localStorage-powered flows; the production backend specs live here for future engineers only.

---

## üéØ Project Scope Overview

**What We're Building:** Interactive UI/UX prototype using localStorage to demonstrate all features and validate user flows.

**What We're NOT Building:** Production system with real database, authentication, or email services.

**Production Build:** Real developers will use our documentation to build the production system (18-22 weeks after prototype handoff).

---

## üìÅ Documentation Overview

This folder contains:
1. **Prototype implementation tracking** - Current progress and next steps for our team
2. **Production reference documentation** - Database schemas, RBAC design, API specs for future developers

The Class2Class Partner Platform is a multi-layered system for managing educational programs, partners, coordinators, institutions, and teachers.

---

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Before Starting Phase 1:
- ‚úÖ Complete Phase 0 checklist
- ‚úÖ All backend infrastructure working
- ‚úÖ No `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` for data
- ‚úÖ Authentication tested end-to-end
- ‚úÖ Email delivery verified

### Code Quality:
- Use TypeScript for everything
- Validate all inputs with Zod
- Follow existing component patterns
- Write tests for critical flows
- Document complex logic

### Git Workflow:
- Create feature branches
- Descriptive commit messages
- Code review required
- Test before merging

---

## ü§î Common Questions

### Q: Can we skip Phase 0?
**A:** No. Current codebase has NO backend. Phase 0 is mandatory.

### Q: Can we start Phase 1 and do Phase 0 in parallel?
**A:** Not recommended. Phase 1 features require working backend infrastructure.

### Q: Why is the timeline longer now?
**A:** Original plan assumed a working backend. We discovered it's a UI prototype.

### Q: Can we use a different database than Supabase?
**A:** Yes, but setup time increases from 1-2 weeks to 2-3 weeks.

### Q: What if we already have Supabase set up?
**A:** Great! You can reduce Phase 0 timeline by ~1 week.
