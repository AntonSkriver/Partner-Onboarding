# Park Background Image Setup

Please save the park image you just uploaded as:
`/Users/anton/Partner-Onboarding-3/public/images/park-background.jpg`

You can do this by:
1. Right-click on the park image you uploaded in the chat
2. Save it to your computer
3. Copy it to the path above

Alternatively, you can drag and drop the image file directly into:
`/Users/anton/Partner-Onboarding-3/public/images/`
and rename it to `park-background.jpg`

The banner code is already updated and ready to display the image with the purple gradient!
